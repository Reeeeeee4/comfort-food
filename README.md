# Comfort Food 🍲

**Comfort Food** is my first game project, made with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).  
It’s a cozy, story-driven idle cooking game where you serve emotionally resonant meals to night-time customers and slowly uncover their stories.

### 💡 Features (WIP):
- Idle cooking system with dish timers
- Dialogue-based storytelling
- Emotion-based meal choices
- Pixel art diner aesthetic

### 🎯 Platforms:
- Desktop (Itch.io)
- Mobile (Android) *(planned)*

### 🧑‍🍳 Dev Notes:
This is a learning project where I'm exploring Godot, GDScript, pixel art, and narrative design — all in one cozy little game.
